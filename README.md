# DevSpace 🚀

A real-time collaborative mock interview platform built for developers. Conduct live coding interviews with synchronized editors, AI-generated problems, and structured feedback — all in the browser.

---

## What is DevSpace?

DevSpace lets interviewers and candidates collaborate in a shared coding environment. The interviewer controls the session — generating problems, pushing hints, setting timers, and ending the session with structured feedback. The candidate writes code in a live Monaco editor that syncs in real time.

## Features

### Authentication
- JWT-based auth with HTTP-only cookies
- Protected routes — unauthenticated users redirected to login
- Role-based access — `interviewer` and `candidate` roles with different permissions

### Rooms & Collaboration
- Interviewers create rooms (interview or collab mode)
- Candidates join via unique invite link
- Real-time participant tracking with live avatar stack
- Tab-switch cheat detection — interviewer gets alerted if candidate leaves the window

### Live Code Editor
- Monaco Editor (same as VS Code) shared in real time via Socket.io
- Multi-language support — Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, and more
- Per-problem, per-language code caching — switching problems never loses your work
- Boilerplate auto-loaded on language switch
- Late-join support — joining mid-session restores current editor state
- **Live cursor sync** — each participant's cursor is visible to others in real time, color-coded by user with name on hover

### AI Problem Generation
- Interviewers type a topic → Groq (llama-3.3-70b) generates a full coding problem
- DB cache check first — avoids duplicate Groq calls for same problem
- Problems include: title, description, examples, constraints, boilerplate code per language
- Test cases stored in DB but **never sent to candidate** (anti-cheat)
- Problems sync to candidate screen via socket

### Interviewer Panel (Private)
- **Hint composer** — push hints directly to candidate as a popup
- **Session timer** — set a countdown synced across both screens via end timestamp
- **Private notes** — saved to DB on session end, never visible to candidate

### Session Management
- End Session saves full code snapshots + interviewer notes to DB
- Socket overwrites with server-side code state for accuracy
- Session locked after end — editor becomes read-only for both
- Candidate sees alert when session ends

### Feedback & Review
- Interviewer fills structured feedback form after session (communication, problem solving, code quality, overall — rated 1-5 + comments)
- Full session review page — browse code snapshots per problem/language, view ratings and notes
- Past sessions shown on dashboard with overall score

### Dashboard
- Active rooms with status indicators (waiting / active / ended)
- Session history with score preview
- Candidates can create collab rooms but not interview rooms (role-enforced on frontend + backend)

## How It Works — Core Flows

### Real-time Code Sync
Every keystroke emits `code-change` to server → server updates `roomCodeState` (in-memory Map) → broadcasts `code-update` to the other participant. An `isRemoteUpdate` flag prevents infinite emit loops. `activeProblemRef` and `languageRef` use refs instead of state inside socket listeners to avoid stale closures.

### Live Cursor Sync
Every cursor movement in the Monaco editor emits `cursor-change` to the server → server relays it to everyone else in the room via `socket.to(roomId)` → clients receive `receive-cursor` and update `remoteCursorsRef` (an in-memory map of `userId → { position, userName }`) → all remote cursors are repainted at once using Monaco's `decorationsCollection.set()`.

Each remote cursor is rendered as a decoration with a color class derived from the user's ID (`getUserColorClass`) and a markdown hover tooltip showing their name. Cursor state is stored in a ref (not state) to avoid triggering re-renders on every movement. The sender's own cursor is filtered out on receive using a `userId === myId` guard.

### Problem Generation
`POST /rooms/:roomId/add-problem` → DB regex search first (cache hit = instant, free) → Groq only if not found → saved to DB with `generatedBy` field → room updated → interviewer state updates via HTTP response → candidate notified via `notify-new-problem` socket event.

### Timer Sync
Server calculates `endTime = Date.now() + (minutes * 60 * 1000)` → emits once to both clients → both sides run their own `setInterval` subtracting `Date.now()` every second. Always in sync. No repeated emissions. Saved to `roomCodeState` for late joiners.

### End Session
HTTP PUT first (data safety) → saves code snapshots + notes → creates Session in DB → sets `room.status = "ended"` → returns `sessionId` → socket fires `trigger-end-session` → server overwrites snapshots with more accurate server-side RAM state → `io.to(roomId)` notifies both screens → `roomCodeState` deleted.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why `socket.to()` vs `io.to()`?**
`socket.to()` sends to everyone in the room except the sender. `io.to()` sends to everyone including the sender. Code sync uses `socket.to()` (sender already updated locally). Session end uses `io.to()` (both need to lock).

**Why HTTP before socket on end session?**
Data must be saved to DB before anyone is notified. If socket fired first and HTTP failed — candidate would see "session ended" but nothing would be saved. Write first, notify second.

**Why `temperature: 0.0` for Groq?**
We want consistent, structured JSON output — not creative variation. Zero temperature = deterministic, always follows the schema strictly.

**Why refs for `activeProblem` and `language` inside socket listeners?**
Socket listeners are created once and capture the initial state value (stale closure). Refs always point to the latest value without needing to re-register listeners.

**Why refs for `remoteCursors` instead of state?**
Cursor positions update on every keystroke — dozens of times per second. Storing them in React state would trigger a re-render on each update, destroying editor performance. A ref holds the latest positions without causing any re-renders; Monaco's decoration API is called directly to repaint cursors.

**Why repaint ALL remote cursors on every update?**
Monaco's `decorationsCollection.set()` replaces the entire decoration list atomically. Tracking individual cursors and doing partial updates would risk stale decorations (ghost cursors). Repainting all at once is simpler, consistent, and cheap since the cursor count is small.
